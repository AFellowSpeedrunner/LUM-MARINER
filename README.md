# LUM-MARINER
LUM/MARINER attempts to aim to be a clone of XNU/Darwin written in Rust just without the Apple stuff. A kernel and Operating System.

# What I plan for this?

I plan for LUM/MARINER to become a Unix based kernel in Rust that is almost like a clone of XNU/Darwin to some degree. I plan on making this compatible with Linux/Unix applications and making the kernel modular to allow for easier modifications.

# Why?
I've always found XNU and Darwin really interesting to me and I've always wanted to do stuff with it but due to the way XNU/Darwin is, you can't really do much. Therefore, LUM/MARINER sprung into existance. And well... because why not? It seemed like a fun idea.

# What does LUM stand for?
"Like Unix... Maybe?"

# What does MARINER stand for?
It's a reference to something. I may say it in the future.
