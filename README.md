# LUM/MARINER

[![Latest compile run](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/LUM-MARINER/actions/workflows/buildkern.yml/badge.svg?branch=main)](https://github.com/AFellowSpeedrunner/LUM-MARINER/actions/workflows/buildkern.yml)

LUM/MARINER attempts to aim to be a clone of XNU/Darwin written in Rust just without the Apple stuff. A kernel and Operating System.

Credits to [phil-opp](https://github.com/phil-opp) for the base code of this kernel.

## What do I plan for this?

I plan for LUM/MARINER to become a Unix based kernel in Rust that is almost like a clone of XNU/Darwin to some degree. I plan on making this compatible with Linux/Unix applications and making the kernel modular to allow for easier modifications.

## How do you build this?
Please refer to [BUILD.md](BUILD.md).

## Why?
I've always found XNU and Darwin really interesting to me and I've always wanted to do stuff with it but due to the way XNU/Darwin is, you can't really do much. Therefore, LUM/MARINER sprung into existence. And well... because why not? It seemed like a fun idea.

## What does LUM stand for?
"Like Unix... Maybe?"

## What does MARINER stand for?
It's a reference to something. I may say it in the future.

Oh, and I should probably point out that I'm doing this for fun and learning, before anyone attempts to destroy me for this... I know some people will.
